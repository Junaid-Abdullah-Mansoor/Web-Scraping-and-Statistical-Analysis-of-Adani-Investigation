# Web Scraping and Statistical Analysis of Adani Investigation

This project involves web scraping the document available at [https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/) and conducting a statistical analysis on the extracted data. The objective is to extract meaningful statistics and insights from the document using web scraping techniques and various statistical analysis methods.

## Web Scraping
The document available at [https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/adani/) will be scraped to extract the necessary text and data for analysis. Web scraping involves programmatically retrieving the document's content, including text, headings, links, and other relevant information. The scraped data will serve as the basis for the subsequent statistical analysis.

## Statistical Analysis Metrics
The statistical analysis will focus on extracting and analyzing various metrics from the scraped data, including:

1. Basic Text Analysis:
   - Counting the number of verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech to understand the document's composition and style.

2. Biasing Adjectives:
   - Identifying and counting adjectives with negative sentiment or tone to gauge the document's bias or influence.

3. Citations from Anonymous Sources:
   - Counting the usage of phrases citing anonymous sources to assess the reliance on undisclosed or unidentified references.

4. Citations from Named Sources:
   - Counting the usage of phrases citing named sources to determine the credibility and reliance on specific individuals or organizations.

5. Relative Share of Anonymous to Non-anonymous:
   - Calculating the relative proportions of anonymous citations, non-anonymous citations, and their ratios to the total number of citations.

6. Average Paragraph Length:
   - Computing the average length of paragraphs to understand the document's structural characteristics and writing style.

7. Bold Text Usage:
   - Determining the ratio of bold text to non-bold text to identify emphasized or important sections within the document.

8. Headings vs. Body Text:
   - Comparing the number of headings to the number of lines of body text to assess the document's organization and structure.

9. Images vs. Text Ratio:
   - Calculating the ratio of images to text to analyze the visual content's prominence compared to textual information.

10. Repeated Phrases Verbatim:
    - Identifying and counting instances of exact phrase repetitions to highlight key points or recurring arguments.

11. Repeated Claims:
    - Counting the number of repeated claims, even if not verbatim, to determine the prevalence of recurring assertions.

12. Social Media Links:
    - Counting the number of links to social media platforms to evaluate the document's engagement with external sources.

13. Links to Self-hosting Document Sites:
    - Counting the number of links to self-hosting document sites, such as Slideshare, to gauge external references and sources.

14. Linked Sources:
    - Compiling a comprehensive list of all linked sources to provide a clear reference of external materials cited within the document.

15. Bad Links:
    - Identifying and counting links that lead to pages that are no longer available or result in errors to assess the document's reference reliability.

Additional Metrics and Insights:
- The analysis may uncover additional metrics and insights from the scraped data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the document's content and significance.

## Data Presentation
The results of the statistical analysis will be presented in two formats:

1. Raw Format:
   - The raw data, including counts, ratios, and relevant statistical analyses, will be presented in a structured and tabular format for easy reference and analysis.

2. Rich Format:
   - The analysis findings will be visually presented using charts, graphs, and other rich visualizations to enhance comprehension and facilitate meaningful interpretations of the data.

The combination of raw data and visual representations will provide a

 comprehensive overview of the statistical analysis, enabling readers to gain a better understanding of the document's content and statistical patterns.

## Ethics and Legal Considerations
When performing web scraping, it is important to respect the website's terms of service, copyright laws, and ethical guidelines. Prior permission should be obtained from the website owner or adhere to the website's API terms, if applicable. The data obtained should be used solely for analysis purposes and not for any unauthorized or illegal activities.

It is also essential to maintain data privacy and confidentiality. Personal information or sensitive data should not be extracted or shared without proper consent or anonymization.

## Disclaimer
The statistical analysis presented in this project is based on the available document and the extracted data through web scraping. The accuracy and reliability of the analysis depend on the quality and completeness of the scraped data. The findings and insights should be interpreted with caution and may be subjective in nature.
